# Ignite
This is a Hip-Hop Hacktivist hackathon android app created by participating high-school students.

The idea was pitched by the students prompted to use the the [NYC Open Data API](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) with design input from [Ian Skeen](linkedin.com/in/ianskeen) and build by [Andres Arango](linkedin.com/in/andres1arango) and I


Ignite requests data on training programs provided by the API, then facilitating access to information about these, including address, phone, website and the amount of hours necessary to complete it. The aim of the application is to give people a portal from which they can ignite a spark towards a better future through education.
